# Ronnberg LFO

This is my take on the LFO module designed by Niklas Ronnberg. I’ve changed the range switch with an on-off-on type switch. This way, in the off position, the timing cap consist of a single .001 uF cap, the other 2 positions either add an extra .068uF or 1uF cap. This increases the selectable range quit a bit. I’ve also added a triangle-to-sine converter based on a design by Thomas Henry.
